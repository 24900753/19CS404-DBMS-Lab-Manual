# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.  
- Payments tracked for memberships and sessions.

- Menu items can exist even if they are not ordered.

## Instructions for Students

1. Complete **all three scenarios** (A, B, C).  
2. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes for each.  
3. Draw ER diagrams using **draw.io / diagrams.net** or hand-drawn & scanned.  
4. Fill in all tables and assumptions for each scenario.  
5. Export the completed Markdown (with diagrams) as **a single PDF**
